    <p><b>Eeyore</b> is a melancholic, gloomy donkey who is a part of Winnie the Pooh's circle of friends. Despite his perpetually pessimistic outlook on life, Eeyore is loved by his friends for his loyalty and sincerity.</p>
    <p>Each of the main characters in Winnie the Pooh represents different aspects of mental health, and Eeyore symbolizes major depression disorder and low self-esteem.</p>
    <p>Eeyore's interactions with his friends often highlight the importance of empathy, kindness, and supporting those who are struggling.</p>
    <h4>"<em>A little consideration, a little thought for others, makes all the difference.</em>" - Eeyore</h4>
