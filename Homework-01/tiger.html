    <p><b>Tigger</b> is an energetic and boisterous tiger who loves to bounce and is always full of enthusiasm. He is known for his distinctive personality and his catchphrase "T-T-F-N: Ta-ta for now!"</p>
    <p>Each of the main characters in Winnie the Pooh represents different aspects of mental health, and Tigger's character has been associated with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in some interpretations.</p>
    <p>Tigger's hyperactivity, impulsivity, and tendency to constantly seek new experiences might be interpreted as manifestations of his condition.</p>
