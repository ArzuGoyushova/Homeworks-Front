    <p><b>Owl</b> is a wise and knowledgeable owl who serves as a mentor and advisor to the other characters in the Hundred Acre Wood. He is known for his intelligence, eloquence, and love of storytelling.</p>
    <p>Some interpretations of Owl's character suggest traits associated with narcissistic personality disorder (NPD), such as a grandiose sense of self-importance and a need for admiration. However, Owl's portrayal can also be seen as a reflection of his confidence and leadership qualities.</p>
    <h4>"<em>Well, it's like this, little Piglet. We all have to go to school, and study and learn our lessons. And there's always something to be learned.</em>" - Owl</h4>
